## DeSeq2 Analysis
- filters lowly expressed genes or miRNAs
- normalizing count data based on median signal intensity to obtain variance stabilized expression values
- This research specifically investigates the impact of wildfire smoke exposure on the genome and epigenome


# Mice_Heart_Lung_mRNA_DeSeq2
> identifies mRNAs associated with wildfire smoke exposure (Peat, Red Oak, Saline, Pine, or Eucalyptus) under two burn conditions (flame or smolder) on heart and lung tissue in mice


# Mice_Plasma_miRNA_DeSeq2
> identifies miRNAs associated with wildfire smoke exposure (Peat or  Red Oak) under smoldering conditions in mice plasma

# Human_miRNA_DeSeq2
> identifies miRNAs associated with wildfire smoke exposure (Red Oak) under smoldering conditions in humans
